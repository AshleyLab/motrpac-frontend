### Directory Layout and Setup

#### File Structure

│   ├── index.js  
│   ├── main.css: Compiled from sass/main.sass  
│   ├── reducers: Handles logic for redux store  
│   ├── sass: source sass styling  
│   ├── stories: UI visual tests for storybook  
│   ├── storybook.test.js: initialize snapshots for storybook tests

#### Flow for creating new components
  1. Create \[component\].jsx file in src/components
  2. Create storybook snapshots file \[component\].stories.jsx
  3. Create tests in tests/components/\[component\].test.jsx
  4. Integrate required actions in to associated reducer (ex. for upload handling logic that would be src/reducers/uploadReducer.js)
  5. If it is a full page, add routing logic to src/App.jsx

#### Building and running

 * Running React App 
   - `yarn start`
   - runs core React app at localhost:3000

 * Running Storybook:
   - `yarn run storybook`
   - runs storybook server at localhost:9009

 * testing:
   - `yarn test`
   - runs tests and storybook snapshots
   - `yarn test --coverage`
   - runs all tests and returns table illustrating code coverage

 * Building CSS: Uses sass in node_modules/sass/sass.js
   - `yarn sass`
   - compiles sass from src/sass/main.scss to src/main.css
   - `yarn sass-watch`
   - compiles sass from src/sass/main.scss to src/main.css and watches for changes

### Software versions and styles

#### Software:

 * [Node v10](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
     - Check your version: `node --version`
     - If the version is not 10, you can `brew install node@10` or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation), the Node Version Manager
     
 * [React v16](https://reactjs.org/versions)
     - Storybook used to visualize individual UI components

 * Style guide:
     - [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) 
     - [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
     - [Style Lint Recommended SCSS Guide](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-recommended)

### Additional Notes

#### Notes on redux integration
 - Components that need to be linked to a redux store in implementation are exported by default as connected functions/containers. They are also exported in pure function form (ex: "import { UploadScreen } from 'path/to/component' " for pure function and "import UploadScreen from 'path/to/component'" for container).
 - mapStateToProps used to link the section from the combined reducer to properties required by the container
 - mapDispatchtoProps defines required actions and what to send to a reducer.

#### Potential down the line dependency issues
  - Storybook has trouble integrating with react-router, I installed a package called storybook-react-router to make them work together. If you run in to an issue with storybook saying something like "You should not use <Link > outside <Router >" it has something to do with react-router and storybook-react-router

#### Current navigation/routing implementation
  - React-router is being used to handle routing
  - history ( createBrowserHistory ) is used to update location from button clicks and function calls ( history.push('path/to/new/location') )
  - \< Link > tags  from react-router are used in place of \< a > tags handle navigation from links. Certain elements return \< Redirect to="path/to/new/location" > elements if protected and user not authenticated.
  - Analysis page only uses routing to differentiate between human and analysis (/analysis/human or /analysis/animal). After that it acts as a single page application.

#### Download Page Behavior
  - Makes call to backend for a list of uploads (size depending maxRows variable) on a given page. Expects backend to give total count of uploads fitting filters and the uploads for a specific page. (e.g on page 2, with 10 rows per page, expects items 11-20  from backend and a count of all  rows that fit current filters)
  - Changing filters should also call backend
